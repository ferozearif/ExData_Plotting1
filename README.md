Exploratory Data Analysis - Project 1
=====================================

This submission comprises of plot1.R, plot1.png, plot2.R, plot2.png, plot3.R, plot3.png, plot4.R and plot4.png


Project Description
-------------------
Create the following plots:

1. Plot 1 - Global Active Power Histogram - Global Active Power (kilowatts) Vs Frequency

2. Plot 2 - Global Active Power (Y - Axis - 0, 2, 4, 6) Vs Time (X - Axis - Thu, Fri, Sat)

3. Plot 3 - Energy submetering (Y-Axis - 0, 10, 20, 30) Vs Time (X - Axis - Thu, Fri, Sat) Includes Sub_mtering_1 (black), Sub_metering_2 (red) and Sub_metering_3 (blue)

4. Plot 4 - Comprises of four plots - Plot 2 & 3 and Voltage Vs datetime, Global reactive power vs datetime

Tasks completed
---------------
1. Fork and clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

2. Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

3. Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.

4. Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also include the code that creates the PNG file.

5. Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

6. When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.
